// Assignment: Operator Practice
// Instructions:// 1. Create a new JavaScript file and save it as "operators.js".
// 2. Write JavaScript code to complete the tasks described below.
// 3. Test your code by running the "operators.js" file in a web browser or using a JavaScript console.
// Tasks:
// 1. Declare two variables called "num1" and "num2" and assign them any numeric values.
// 2. Use the addition operator to calculate the sum of "num1" and "num2". Store the result in a variable called "sum".
// 3. Use the subtraction operator to calculate the difference between "num1" and "num2". Store the result in a variable called "difference".
// 4. Use the multiplication operator to calculate the product of "num1" and "num2". Store the result in a variable called "product".
// 5. Use the division operator to calculate the quotient of "num1" divided by "num2". Store the result in a variable called "quotient".
// 6. Use the modulus operator to calculate the remainder when "num1" is divided by "num2". Store the result in a variable called "remainder".
// 7. Print the following information using console.log():
//    - The sum of num1 and num2: "The sum is [sum]."
//    - The difference between num1 and num2: "The difference is [difference]."
//    - The product of num1 and num2: "The product is [product]."
//    - The quotient of num1 divided by num2: "The quotient is [quotient]."
//    - The remainder when num1 is divided by num2: "The remainder is [remainder]."

var num1=10
var num2=20
var sum=num1+num2
var difference=num1-num2
var product=num1*num2
var quotient=num1/num2
var remainder=num1%num2
console.log("The sum is "+sum)
console.log("The difference is "+difference)
console.log("The product is "+product)
console.log("The quotient is "+quotient)
console.log("The remainder is "+remainder)
